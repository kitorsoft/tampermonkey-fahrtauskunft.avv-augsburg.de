# Tampermonkey Script for https://fahrtauskunft.avv-augsburg.de/
A Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey script that creates a "save to my calendar" button.
AVV keep failing to provide this simple but convenient feature.

# Install
1. Install Tampemonkey (tested) or Greasemonkey (not tested)
2. Install the .js file into Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey
3. when you open a connection in https://fahrtauskunft.avv-augsburg.de/, you should now see a calendar icon, which will create a .ics file to import the connection into your calendar.
